## Introduction
	LED lighting is commonly used in robots for purposes including illumination, communication, and aesthetics. This article covers key topics in LED lighting design and implementation as relevant to the robotics field.
	As robots evolve to work in increasingly unstructured environments, interaction with humans becomes progressively more important to robot success. Often, humans are trained to work around robots (for example, in warehouse and manufacturing environments), while in other scenarios humans may be purchasing or encountering their first robot (for example, robot vacuums or mobile delivery robots). In both cases, LED lighting can serve as an efficient and cost-effective means to enhance robots’ utility in areas such as communication, aesthetics, and illumination. 
	Well-executed LED lighting may appear simple from a user’s perspective, but there can be a deceiving amount of complexity involved in successful execution. In many robotic applications, lighting implementation involves not only the selection of the physical LEDs, but also product design, mechanical design and material selection, electrical considerations, and programming. This guide seeks to provide an overview of key topics in the application of LED lighting to robots.
    
## Examples of Lighting on Robots
